- Simple Reflex Agent 
- Model-Based Reflex Agents
- Goal-Based Agents

*Rational Agent:* The rational agent considers all possibilities and chooses to perform the highly efficient action. For example, it chooses the shortest path with low cost for high efficiency. 

**PEAS** stands for a Performance measure, Environment, Actuator, Sensor. 
 
*Supervised Learning :* we have the data set and the equivalents of this data set are also available. It tries to make a new prediction by giving the input and output values.
 
*Unsupervised Learning :* it is a learning method that creates certain groups with the Clustering method according to the characteristics of the data we have.
